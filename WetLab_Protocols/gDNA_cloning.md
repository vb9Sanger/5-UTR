# sgRNA Cloning 

## Annealing sgRNA Oligos:

| Reagent | Volume |
| :--- | :--- |
| guide oligo F (100uM) | 	1.5ul | 
| Guide oligo R (100uM) |	1.5ul | 
| 10x NEB Buffer 2 | 	5ul  | 
| H20 | 	42ul  | 

### PCR conditions 
"anneal" protocol in old PCR machine 

## Ligation:

| Reagent | Volume |
| :--- | :--- |
| Oligo Mix (1:10 dilution) | 	1ul | 
| Cut Vector  (30ng) |	1ul | 
| T4 Ligase | 	1ul  | 
| H20 | 	to 10ul  | 

### Notes:
* Ligate for 1-6h 


## Transformation: 
* Transform into NEB-10beta competent E. coli
* Add 2ul of ligation mix to 50ul cells
* Protocol according to manufacturer’s protocols 

## MiniPrep:
* Create 1:1000 LB:AMP (eg 400ul AMP in 400ml LB broth)
* Add 3ml of LB + AMP to tubes with clear caps
* Select a single colony with a P200
* Dump whole tip into tube
* At end of day, put tubes in shaker overnight at 37C
* Next day: remove tubes from shaker
* Swirl, then add 2ml to a 2ml tube 
* Miniprep according to manufarturer’s protocol

### Sequencing: 
* Send samples off for Sanger Sequencing to validate constructs 

## Maxiprep:
* Create 1:1000 LB:AMP (eg 400ul AMP in 400ml LB broth)
* Add 3ml of LB + AMP to tubes with clear caps
* Select a single colony with a P200 from initial plates
* Dump whole tip into tube
* In morning, put tubes in shaker at 37C
* At the end of the day: Add 300ul of grown up cells to 100ml LB + AMP in 250ml flask
* Shake overnight
* Maxiprep according to manufacturer’s protocols 

### Sequencing: 
* Send samples off for Sanger Sequencing to validate constructs
