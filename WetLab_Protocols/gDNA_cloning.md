# sgRNA Cloning 

## Annealing sgRNA Oligos:

| Reagent | Volume |
| :--- | :--- |
| guide oligo F (100uM) | 	1.5ul | 
| Guide oligo R (100uM) |	1.5ul | 
| 10x NEB Buffer 2 | 	5ul  | 
| H20 | 	42ul  | 

### PCR conditions 
"anneal" protocol in old PCR machine 

## Ligation:

| Reagent | Volume |
| :--- | :--- |
| Oligo Mix (1:10 dilution) | 	1ul | 
| Cut Vector  (30ng) |	1ul | 
| T4 Ligase | 	1ul  | 
| H20 | 	to 10ul  | 

### Notes:
* Ligate for 1-6h 


## Transformation: 

1. Thaw a tube of NEB 10-beta E.coli cells on ice
2. Add 2ul plasmid DNA to 50ul of cells
3. Flick 4-5x to mix
4. Place mix on ice for 30min
5. Heat shock at 42C for 30sec
6. Place on ice for 5min
7. Pipette 950ul of RT outgrowth medium into mix
8. Place at 37C for 60min and shake at 250rpm
9. Warm plates to 37C
10. Mix cells thoroughly by flicking / inverting
11. Spread 1 plate with 40ul of mix, and another with 400ul evenly
12. Incubate overnight at 37C

### Notes:  
* Protocol according to manufacturer’s protocols 

## MiniPrep: (QIAGEN - Cat. No. 28106)
* Create 1:1000 LB:AMP (eg 400ul AMP in 400ml LB broth)
* Add 3ml of LB + AMP to tubes with clear caps
* Select a single colony with a P200
* Dump whole tip into tube
* At end of day, put tubes in shaker overnight at 37C
* Next day: remove tubes from shaker
* Swirl, then add 2ml to a 2ml tube 
* Miniprep according to manufarturer’s protocol

### QC Sequencing: 
* Send samples off for Sanger Sequencing to validate constructs 

## Maxiprep: (QIAGEN - Cat. No. 12963)
* Create 1:1000 LB:AMP (eg 400ul AMP in 400ml LB broth)
* Add 3ml of LB + AMP to tubes with clear caps
* Select a single colony with a P200 from initial plates
* Dump whole tip into tube
* In morning, put tubes in shaker at 37C
* At the end of the day: Add 300ul of grown up cells to 100ml LB + AMP in 250ml flask
* Shake overnight
* Maxiprep according to manufacturer’s protocols 

### QC Sequencing: 
* Send samples off for Sanger Sequencing to validate constructs
